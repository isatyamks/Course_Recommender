The task was to find the product of all elements in an array except for the current element, without using division and with a time complexity of O(n).\nKey Approach:\nPrefix and Suffix Multiplication: Used two passes—one for prefix products and another for suffix products to efficiently calculate the result without division.\nSpace Optimization: Solved the problem in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space (excluding the output array), focusing on reducing extra space usage.\nThis problem was a great exercise in understanding array manipulation and optimizing space usage. It’s always satisfying to see a well-structured solution come together!\nExcited to keep solving more complex problems and pushing my skills further! 🚀\n#DSA #Day27 #C++ #LeetCode #ProductOfArrayExceptSelf #TechSkills #ArrayManipulation #AlgorithmOptimization #DataStructures #ProgrammingJourney #BTechLife #DeveloperJourney #ProblemSolving #CodeOptimization #StudentDeveloper #SoftwareDevelopment",

This cycle length is 2 * (n-1), because the pillow goes through n-1 steps to reach the last person and n-1 steps to come back to the first person.\nDetermine how many complete cycles (completed) the time can fit into by dividing the time by (n-1).\n2. Calculate Remaining Steps:\nAfter calculating the complete cycles, determine the remaining steps (remaining) by taking the modulo of the time with (n-1).\n3. Determine the Final Position:\nIf the number of complete cycles is even, the pillow is moving from the first person to the last person. Thus, the position is remaining + 1.\nIf the number of complete cycles is odd, the pillow is moving back from the last person to the first person. Thus, the position is n - remaining.\nTime Complexity : O(1)\nSpace Complexity : O(1)\nProblem Link : https://rb.gy/zbnyst\n#Coding #CompetitiveProgramming #dsa #DatastructuresAndAlgorithms\n#Leetcode #Consistency #Programming #CodingChallenge",

The main goal was to pinpoint a pair of elements whose sum comes closest to the specified target, with a focus on optimizing the absolute difference, especially in scenarios where multiple pairs approached the target closely.\n\nThe primary technique utilized for this task was the two-pointer approach. By sorting the array and methodically adjusting pointers from both ends, we effectively minimized the gap between the pair's sum and the target value. Ensuring the optimization of the absolute difference was seamlessly accomplished by continuously evaluating it with each pair update.\n\nThis challenge highlighted the adeptness required to incorporate various conditions into a concise and effective solution.\n\n#GFG160 #Day42 #GeekStreak2024 #TwoPointers #ClosestPairSum #EfficientSolutions",
