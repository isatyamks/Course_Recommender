Each time I try to understand it further, I learn something new. \n\nAt Vizuara, we wanted to create a comprehensive webinar series on transformers that will serve as the go-to resource for anyone who wishes to learn transformers, including its implementation.\n\nWe have hosted a 100-minute lecture on our YouTube channel: https://lnkd.in/g2GC938P\n\nWe have covered the following points:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ History of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n2Ô∏è‚É£ What are transformers?\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Intuition behind transformers\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Transformer architecture\n5Ô∏è‚É£ NanoGPT\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Applications of transformers for LLMs\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Building awesome hands-on projects!\n\nHere is the link to the lecture\n\nThe amount of blood, sweat, and research that went into making an almost beginner-friendly workshop was enormous. All credit to Sahil for that. Your work has been very inspirational.\n\nWe strongly believe that this lecture will tremendously benefit you if you wish to learn about LLMs, transformers, attention mechanisms, the intuition behind positional encoding, etc. in detail.",
